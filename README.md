Python program is designed to take three integer inputs from the user and compute the maximum, minimum, and average of those values. Below is a breakdown of the code, its functionality, and suggestions for improvement.

Code Breakdown
Main Function:

The main() function collects three integer values from the user.
It then calls three helper functions to calculate the maximum, minimum, and average of the input values.
Finally, it prints the results.
Helper Functions:

maximum_three(value1, value2, value3): Returns the maximum of the three values using the built-in max() function.
minimum_three(value1, value2, value3): Returns the minimum of the three values using the built-in min() function.
average_three(value1, value2, value3): Calculates the average by summing the three values and dividing by 3.
